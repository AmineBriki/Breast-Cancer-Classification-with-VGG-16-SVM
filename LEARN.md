This is a **_Breast Cancer Classification_** Model based on fine-tuned **_VGG-16_** and _**SVM**_ to classify the [**_INbreast_** Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19n-p9p9C0eCQA1ybm6wkMo-bbeccT_62/view?usp=sharing)
I have used a whole image model by Li Shen, trained it on Google Colab and added an SVM.svc classifier on top
Mr. Li Shen's model had performed great with AUC=0.95, I managed to get AUC=0.98 with SVM and even better with MLP and Random Forests:

This was the project implementation of my Master Graduation Thesis, You can check it out [HERE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361441022_Medical_Images_Classification_Based_on_Deep_Features_Extraction_Exploiting_Transfer_Learning)!
